        <h1> Wisdom </h1>
        <p>
            A student was complaining about digital numbers.<br/> <em>'When I take the root
            of two and then square it again, the result is already inaccurate!'</em>.<br/>
            Overhearing him, <a href="../people/fu-tzu.html">Fu-Tzu</a> laughed, and said <em>'Here is a sheet of paper. Write down
            the precise value of the square root of two for me'</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fu-Tzu said <em>'When you cut against the grain of the wood, much strength
            is needed.'<br>'When you program against the grain of a problem, much code
            is needed'</em>.

        <h2> The debate: Tzu-li &amp; Tzu-ssu </h2>
        <p>
            <a href="../placeholder.html">Tzu-li</a> and <a href="../placeholder.html">Tzu-ssu</a> were boasting about the size of their latest programs.<br/>
            <em>'Two-hundred thousand lines'</em>, said Tzu-li, <em>'not counting comments!'</em>.<br/>
            <em>'Psah'</em>, said Tzu-ssu, <em>'mine is almost a MILLION lines already.'</em><br/>
            Fu-Tzu said <em>'My best program has five hundred lines.'</em><br/>
            Hearing this, Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were enlightened.

            A student had been sitting motionless behind his computer for hours, frowning darkly.<br/>
            He was trying to write a beautiful solution to a difficult problem, but could not find the right approach.<br/>
            Fu-tzu hit him on the back of his head and shouted <em>'Type something!'</em>.<br/>
            The student started writing an ugly solution. After he had finished, he suddenly understood the beautiful solution.
