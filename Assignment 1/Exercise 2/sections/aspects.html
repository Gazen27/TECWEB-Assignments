    <h1> The Two Aspects </h1>
    <p>
        Below the surface of the machine, the program moves.<br/> Without effort,
        it expands and contracts. In great harmony, electrons scatter and
        regroup.<br/> The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water. The
        essence stays invisibly below.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the creators built the machine, they put in the <em>processor</em> and the
        <em>memory</em>.<br/> From these arise <ins>the two aspects of the program</ins>.

<h2> Processor &amp; Memory</h2>
<p>
    The aspect of the processor is the active substance. It is called
    <em>Control</em>.<br/> The aspect of the memory is the passive substance. It is
    called <em>Data</em>.
</p>

<h3> Data &amp; Control </h3>
<p>
    Data is made of merely bits, yet it takes complex forms. Control
    consists only of simple instructions, yet it performs difficult
    tasks.<br/> From the small and trivial, the large and complex arise.
</p>
<p>   
    The program source is Data. Control arises from it. The Control
    proceeds to create new Data.<br/> The one is born from the other, the
    other is useless without the one. This is the harmonious cycle of
    Data and Control.
</p>
<p>    
    Of themselves, Data and Control are without structure.<br/> The programmers
    of old moulded their programs out of this raw substance.<br> Over time,
    the amorphous Data has crystallised into data types, and the chaotic
    Control was restricted into control structures and functions.
